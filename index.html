    <p style="margin-top: 1%; text-align; "> chicken Karahi is arguably the most popular dish in both Pakistan and India and one that
     is my absolute favorite.Karahi is named after the pan in which it was originally cooked  a heavy, often cast-iron
      pan thats similar to a wok, but rounder with a flatter base. Traditionally, meat would be simmered and stir-fried
       in this karahi in an open fire</p>
