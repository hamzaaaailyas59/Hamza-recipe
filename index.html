    <h1 style="text-align: center"> <u> <b> CHICKEN KARHAI </b> </u> </h1> 


    <img style="margin-left: 24%;" width="50%"  src="./KARAHHAI.jpg">
    <p style="margin-top: 1%; text-align; "> chicken Karahi is arguably the most popular dish in both Pakistan and India and one that
     is my absolute favorite.Karahi is named after the pan in which it was originally cooked  a heavy, often cast-iron
      pan thats similar to a wok, but rounder with a flatter base. Traditionally, meat would be simmered and stir-fried
       in this karahi in an open fire</p>

       <h3> <u> <b> INGREDIENTS </b> </u> </h3>
       <ol>
         <li>1/3 cup oil </li>
         <li>1 red onion chopped </li>
         <li>1 whole chicken skinless and cut into 14-16 pieces </li>
         <li> 1/3 cup plain yogurt </li>
         <li> 11/2 tsp cumin </li>
         <li> 2 tsp coriander seeds crushed </li>
         <li> 1 1/2 tsp kashmiri lal mirch or cayenne </li>
         <li> 3/4 -1 tsp salt taste and adjust </li>
         <li> 1/2 tsp black pepper </li>
         <li> 1 tbsp ginger garlic paste </li>
         <li> 5 tomatoes chopped </li>
         <li> 1/4 cup water </li>
         <li> 1/2 cup cilantro chopped </li>
         <li> 2-3 green chilies slit lengthwise </li>

     </ol>

     <h3> <u> <b> INSTRUCTIONS </b> </u> </h3>
     <ul>
        <li> In a wok over medium heat, add oil </li>
        <li> Once oil is hot, toss in the chopped onions and fry for 6-7 minutes or until the edges start to brown </li>
        <li> Next, add the rinsed chicken pieces and stir until combined with the onion </li>
        <li> Add yogurt, cumin, coriander seeds, red chilli powder, salt, pepper and ginger garlic paste and stir until 
            the chicken pieces are coated </li>
        <li> Continue stirring for about 5-6 minutes on high heat </li>
        <li> Tip in the tomatoes, cilantro and chillies and stir. Add water </li>
        <li> Cover the wok with a lid, turn the flame to medium to low and let the karahi cook for 20 minutes </li>
        <li> After 20 minutes, remove the lid and turn the flame to high and let the water evaporate </li>
        <li> Once the water evaporates about 10-15 minutes, start to stir again </li>
        <li> You will notice that the curry will release oil and you'll see a lovely sheen around the edge of the wok.
             At this point  add in some more cilantro and chilli and pop the lid back on and turn the flame to the lowest
             possible setting for 5-10 minutes. This is called the "dum" stage which is important to finish off the 
             Karahi </li>
         <li> Enjoy hot with pita bread or naan! Serves 5-6 people </li>


     </ul>
